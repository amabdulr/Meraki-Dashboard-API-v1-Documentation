# Getting started with Meraki dashboard API

The Meraki Dashboard API is a programming interface that allows users to interact with and manage their Meraki networks programmatically. It provides access to various operations such as retrieving organizations, networks, devices, and device uplink addresses. The API supports multiple authentication methods, including bearer tokens, and offers flexibility in accessing data related to network configurations and status.

# Authorization using bearer token 
The Meraki Dashboard API requires authorization using a Bearer token (or BEARER_TOKEN), which can be
- the Meraki API Key, or
- the OAuth access token.

Include the following in your request header:

```JSON
{
 "Authorization": "Bearer <BEARER_TOKEN>"
}
```

```curl
curl https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}'
```

```Python
import meraki
dashboard = meraki.DashboardAPI(BEARER_TOKEN)
```

For more information, see [Authorization](#!authorization).

# Using Postman for Meraki API 

Use Postman to explore and interact with the Meraki API.  

**Before you begin**: Ensure that you have Postman installed and your Bearer token ready. 
Follow these steps to use Postman:

- **Step 1:** Go to [Postman and our Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/897512/SzYXYfmJ).
- **Step 2:** Import the collection by clicking the 'Run in Postman' button.
- **Step 3:** Use your Bearer token for authorization. (comment: add link to the authorization section)
- **Step 4:** Explore the endpoints available in the collection.

**Result:** You can now interact with Meraki networks using Postman. 

# Using Python library for Meraki API 

Use the Meraki Python library to interact with the API programmatically.  
**Before you begin**: Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.  
Follow these steps to use the Python library:

- **Step 1:** Install the library using the command `pip install meraki`.
- **Step 2:** Import the library in your Python script with `import meraki`.
- **Step 3:** Initialize the Dashboard API with `dashboard = meraki.DashboardAPI(BEARER_TOKEN)`.

**Result:** You can now perform API operations within your Python scripts.


# Finding organization ID 

Retrieve your organization ID to perform further operations.  
Follow these steps to get your organization ID:

- **Step 1:** List the organisations you have access to. Send a GET request to the `/organizations` endpoint. For more information, see [Get Organization](##!get-organizations) API.

### Example Request:

```cURL
curl https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations \
  -L -H 'Authorization: Bearer {MERAKI-API-KEY}'
```

```Python
import meraki
dashboard = meraki.DashboardAPI(API_KEY)
response = dashboard.organizations.getOrganizations()
```

- **Step 2:** Retrieve the `id` from the response. This `id` is organizationâ€™s identifier.

### Example Response:  

```JSON
Successful HTTP Status: 200
[
  {
    "id": "549236",
    "name":"DevNet Sandbox"
  }
]
```

```Python
>>> print(response)
[{'id': '549236', 'name': 'DevNet Sandbox'}]
```
**Note:** Irrelevant response attributes are omitted from the examples for brevity.
**Result:** You have your organization ID for subsequent API requests.  
**Post-requisite:** Note the organization ID for subsequent API requests.  

# Finding network ID 
List the networks of your organization using the organization ID.

Follow these steps to get your network ID:

Step 1: Use the GET /organizations/:organizationId/networks endpoint.
Step 2: Provide your organization ID and API key in the request.
Step 3: Extract the network ID from the response for further actions.

Result: You obtain the network ID for network-specific operations.**Example Response:**
```
[
  {
    "id": "N_1234",
    "organizationId": "12345678",
    "type": "wireless",
    "name": "My network",
    "timeZone": "US/Pacific",
    "tags": null
  }
]
```
# Finding devices and serials 
List the devices in your organization to obtain serials.

Follow these steps to find devices and their serials:

Step 1: Send a GET request to /organizations/:organizationId/devices.
Step 2: Include your organization ID and API key in the request.
Step 3: Note the serial numbers of the devices from the response.

**Result**: You have device serials for operations involving specific devices.

**Example Response:**
```
[
    {
        "name": "My AP",
        "lat": 37.4180951010362,
        "lng": -122.098531723022,
        "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave",
        "notes": "My AP note",
        "tags": [ "recently-added" ],
        "networkId": "N_24329156",
        "serial": "Q234-ABCD-5678",
        "model": "MR34",
        "mac": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
        "lanIp": "1.2.3.4",
        "firmware": "wireless-25-14",
        "productType": "wireless"
    }
]
```

# Getting devices uplink addresses 

Retrieve uplink addresses for specific devices using their serials.

Follow these steps to get uplink addresses:

Step 1: Use the endpoint /organizations/:organizationId/devices/uplinks/addresses/byDevice.
Step 2: Include serials[] query parameters for the devices.
Step 3: Authenticate with your API key and send the request.

Result: You receive the uplink addresses for the specified devices.**Example Response:**
```
[
 {
  "mac": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
